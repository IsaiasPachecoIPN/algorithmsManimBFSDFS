# algorithmsManimProyect

Project developed to show how BFS and DFS algorithm works

The "inputdata" file contains all the vertex and edges from the Graph.

	vertices:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
	edges:1-2,2-3,3-4,2-4,2-5,6-5,1-7,5-7,2-8,1-9,10-8,5-11
	root:1

>Example of input data file

To run the project, manim have to be installed and all its requirement. Then run the following code.

	manim -pql main.py CreateScene

#Output
